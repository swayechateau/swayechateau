## About Me

Passionate about software development and continuously exploring new technologies and paradigms. Here are some areas I am particularly interested in:

- **Golang**: Loving the simplicity and performance. It‚Äôs my go-to language for building efficient and reliable applications.
- **Elixir**: The concurrency model and fault tolerance features make Elixir an exciting language to work with.
- **PHP**: A versatile language that I have used extensively for web development.
- **JavaScript**: Essential for front-end development and creating interactive web applications.
- **.NET Core**: I appreciate its cross-platform capabilities and robustness for building enterprise-level applications.

## Currently Reading

Currently reading "[The Unicorn Project][the_unicorn_project]" after finishing "[The Phoenix Project][the_phoenix_project]". These books offer incredible insights into DevOps and modern software development practices, and they have significantly influenced my approach to building and managing software systems.

## Interests

- **Game Development**: Combining creativity and technical skills to create immersive experiences is something I'm deeply passionate about. I enjoy experimenting with different game engines and learning about game design and mechanics.
- **Software Architecture**: Fascinated by the principles of designing scalable, maintainable, and efficient systems. I strive to learn and implement best practices in my projects.
